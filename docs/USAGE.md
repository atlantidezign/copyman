To assist with **selection**, you can use the **Filters**.
There are filters for file and folder **Name**, file and folder **Date** and file **Size**.

For each group, we have **Addictive** (+) filters, and **Subtractive** (-) filters.
**Addictive Filters** of each group are in **OR** condition. Eg. with 2 different strings for Addictives Name Filters, will be selected every item matches string1 or string2.
A **Substractive Filter** removes from selection every item matches, as a **NOT** condition.

**Relationship** between Addictive filters of different groups can be an **OR** or **AND** condition, according to options.
*OR* means that item is selected if **at least one** of the group conditions matches, *AND* means that **all** conditions must match.
