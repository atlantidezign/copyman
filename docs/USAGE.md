### Folders
You need to choose a **Source** folder and at least one **Destination** folder.  
Use the corresponding **Clear** buttons to remove the folder selections.

You can also **Refresh Source Folder Tree**.

In Destination folders list, you can *drag* elements (badges) over each other to rearrange order.


---

### Tree and Selection
Within the **tree view**, you can **select** the items to copy (whether files or folders) using checkboxes (you can also click on names).

You can navigate within the tree by **expanding** or **collapsing** branches.  
You can also use the two buttons for **Expand or Collapse All**.

To select/unselect all items you can use the two buttons **Select All** and **Deselect All**.

You can also choose the **Sort order** of the tree. Possible values are:
- Alphabetical ASC
- Alphabetical DESC
- Size ASC
- Size DESC
- Date ASC
- Date DESC
- Type ASC
- Type DESC

In **tree view**
- if the **Split Screen** option is enabled, the view is divided into two adjustable columns:
  - On the left side, we display the **Source Folder** Tree.
  - On the right side, we display the First **Destination Folder** Tree.
- if the **Tree Diffs** options is active, for each tree also missing files will be shown, and different files will be marked.

The Destination tree is *aligned* with the Source tree. This means that for any item in the Source tree, if an item with same relative path exists also on the Destination Tree:
- If the checkbox is selected or deselected, the corresponding checkbox in the Destination tree matches that state.
- If a folder in the Source tree is expanded or collapsed, the corresponding folder in the Destination tree is also expanded or collapsed, respectively.

### Copying
With the **Execute Copy** button, the files are copied from the Source to the Destinations.

**Pay attention:** Copy process is **strict** on selection:
only and exclusively the selected items will be copied.
For example, if a folder is selected but only some of the files inside it are selected, only those will be copied.

In **Options** panel you can choose between different **Copy modes**

With **Preview** switch you can enable/disable *Preview Mode*: Copying is not performed, but the report is generated.

During copying, you can **Abort** process.

#### Zipping
With the **Zip** button, a zip archive of selected Items is created, then copied to the Destinations.
Also during zipping, you can **Abort** process.

### Filters
To assist with **selection**, you can use the **Filters**.
There are filters for file and folder **Name**, file and folder **Date**, file **Size**, file and folder **Diffs**.

For each group, we have **Addictive** (+) filters, and **Subtractive** (-) filters.
**Addictive Filters** of each group are in **OR** condition. Eg: with 2 different strings for Addictives Name Filters, will be selected every item matches string1 or string2.
A **Substractive Filter** removes from selection every item matches, as a **NOT** condition.

**Relationship** between Addictive filters of different groups can be an **OR** or **AND** condition, according to options.
*OR* means that item is selected if **at least one** of the group conditions matches, *AND* means that **all** conditions must match.

Filter panel is collapsable.
